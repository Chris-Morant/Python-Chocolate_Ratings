# Project Overview
Flavors of Cacao is a website run by the Manhattan Chocolate Society dedicated to rating chocolate bars through research and taste testing. The website has reviewed over 2,700 different chocolate bars and has collected data on their composition, production and rating. This data can be used to explore and identify the factors, such as cocoa percent and bean origin, that are most common on high rated chocolate bars. The goal of this data exploration is to determine what the ideal factors are for the best chocolate experience. 

Python is used for the purposes of cleaning and analyzing the data for later use in a Tableau presentation.

## Key Questions and Objectives
- The main objective is to find the best recommendation for a chocolate bar based on its ingredients, cacao bean, and chocolate manufacturer using reviews.
- The following questions will be used as guidelines to help with the final recommendation:
  1. Which manufacturer has the greatest number of high rated chocolate bars?
  2. Where are the highest rated chocolate bars manufactured?
  3. Which combination of ingredients has the highest ratings?
  4. Where are the highest rated cacao beans grown?
  5. Does a high percentage of cacao result in a higher rating?

## Data
The data set used for this project was found using kaggle and originates from the flavours of cacao website.
